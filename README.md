# ✈️ British Airways Virtual Internship - Customer Insights & Predictive Analytics

Welcome aboard! This repository contains the deliverables from my virtual internship with **British Airways**. The focus of this project is to extract actionable insights from customer data and develop a predictive model that can help the airline make data-driven decisions around customer engagement and booking behavior.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The core objectives of this project include:

- 📊 Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in customer reviews and service interactions.
- 💬 Conducting **Sentiment Analysis** using NLP techniques to evaluate customer feedback and overall satisfaction.
- 🤖 Building a **Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier)** to predict which customers are likely (or unlikely) to book flights or hotels.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- NLTK / VADER (for Sentiment Analysis)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control
